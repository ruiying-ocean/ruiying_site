# Introduction
This post is to simply introduce how to make a map in R environment, or more officially,
geographic/spatial visualisation. However, I just found numerous methods to do this in R,
depending on which data type you have. So this post will not introduce the basic of R and GIS.
After all, I am also not an expert in this.


To make a map, at least two types of data are needed:
* Geographic Information System (GIS) data for position
* Research data _per se_ for value

Sometimes these two are combined to a unified data (e.g., population data as an attribute in a shapefile). However, 
in most cases for those who are not studying geography (like me), we have to join
the research data (in csv, netCDF) to GIS fields based on shared "key/id column". The relevant GIS data probably can be found in third-party packages such as `maps` or `mapdata`, but for more demands like custom resolution, one have to download in other sources.

# CSV file with lat and long columns

There are two methods to plot a csv data frame on a map:

- plot layers using `ggplot2`

- transform to `sf`

Because the latter one is same to sections below, so I will introduce `ggplot2`, 
which is very (but not limitedly) proficient at analysing data frames.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(maps) # outline data for continents,countries
library(mapdata) # extra map datasets
library(mapproj) # map projection
#library(maptools)

# a quickest method to plot a global map
# map("world")

# Here I create a simple dataframe, which can be replaced to your data by read.csv()
toy_df <- data.frame(city = c("Bristol", "Shangrao"),
                     long = c(51.45, 28.45),
                     lat = c(-2.59, 117.94))

world <- map_data("world") # a ggplot2 function to get a world data.frame,see also borders

# notice x is lat and y is long, which differs normal impression
ggplot(world) +
  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group=group)) + 
  geom_label(data= toy_df, aes(lat, long, label=city)) +
  coord_map("mollweide", xlim=c(-180,180)) + # change the projection
  theme_minimal()
```

Actually`ggfortify` provides the `autoplot` function, which is a quicker wrapper for ggplot2. So
we can do the same by using less command.
```{r}
library(ggfortify)
world <-  map('world', plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE)
autoplot(world, geom = 'polygon') +
  geom_point(data = toy_df, aes(lat, long),
             color="red", size=2)
```

There is another geom type: geom_map in ggplot. The difference between geom_map and 
geom_polygon is that the latter just plot the polygon (or position) and does not care about 
the value, but the geom_map contains both position and value information. Therefore,
there must be a id columns shared by both polygon and value data frames, but no
need to add lat/long in aes().

An example
```{r}
fr_map <- map_data("france")
fr_data <- data.frame(region = unique(fr_map$region), 
                      value     = rnorm(length(unique(fr_map$region))))

ggplot(fr_data, aes(map_id = region)) +
  geom_map(aes(fill = value), map=fr_map) +
  expand_limits(x = fr_map$long, y = fr_map$lat) +
  coord_fixed()
```

# sf object + geom_sf

shp file can be read in R through `sf` or `rgal`, and then plot using `ggplot` .
```{r}
#from https://r-spatial.org/r/2018/10/25/ggplot2-sf.htm
library(sf)
library(rnaturalearth) #another public map data package
#library(rnaturalearthdata)

it_data =st_as_sf(map("italy", plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE)) #polygons
it_sf <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", country="italy",returnclass = "sf") #an outline
ggplot(it_sf)+geom_sf()+geom_sf(data = it_data, fill = NA) 
#and you can add more geom_sf() based on data in your  hand
#plot(uk_sf$geometry) #uk_sf$geometry equals st_geomety(uk_sf)
```

# sf object + tmap

`tmap` has a similar layer-based syntax to plot map, but should be more professional and specilised than `ggplot2.`
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#from https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/adv-map.html
library(spData)
library(spDataLarge)
library(tmap)
library(sf)

world <- spData::world
toy_sf <- st_as_sf(toy_df, coords = c("lat", "long"), crs=4326) #WGS84

tm_shape(world)+tm_borders()+tm_fill()+
  tm_shape(toy_sf) + tm_dots(size=.5)
```

# ggmap

`ggmap` is another friendly package for people from other research background, it provides
a function `get_map()` to download some map data from google, open street map and so on.
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ggmap)

#downloading raster data by get_map(). REQUIRE GOOGLE API
gmap <- get_stamenmap(bbox = c(left = -10, bottom = 50, right = 5, top = 60),
                      zoom = 6,
                      maptype='watercolor',
                      messaging = FALSE)

ggmap(gmap) + theme_void()
```


# raster + levelplot/geom_raster

netCDF data can be transformed to raster format.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ncdf4)
library(terra)
library(rasterVis)

# an example file from UCAR
# https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/examples/files.html
nc <- nc_open("tos_O1_2001-2002.nc")
#names(nc$var) # print all variables
sst_K <- ncvar_get(nc, varid="tos") #in Kelvin
sst <- sst_K - 273.15 #in Celsius
#dim(sst) # check dimension
#image(sst[,,1])

sst_raster <- flip(rast(t(sst[,,1])))
levelplot(sst_raster, margin=FALSE,
          main="sea surface temprature 2001-2002")
```

We can also use ggplot to do the plotting. But notice that the array from netCDF is not containing
CRS data, that's why we have x-y axis with 0-1 range.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

#to use geom_raster/geom_tile, we should transfer raster to a data.frame
sst_df <- sst_raster |> terra::as.data.frame(xy=TRUE) #pipe requires R > 4.1, otherwise use %>% in tidyverse
names(sst_df)[3] <- "sst"
ggplot(sst_df) + geom_raster(aes(x=x, y=y, fill=sst)) + theme_light() + scale_fill_viridis_c()

# what's the difference between |> and %>%?
#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67633022/what-are-the-differences-between-rs-new-native-pipe-and-the-magrittr-pipe
```

As for the difference between `geom_tile`, `geom_raster`, let's see the offical answer:

> geom_rect() and geom_tile() do the same thing, but are parameterised differently: geom_rect() uses the locations of the four corners (xmin, xmax, ymin and ymax), while geom_tile() uses the center of the tile and its size (x, y, width, height). geom_raster() is a high performance special case for when all the tiles are the same size.
