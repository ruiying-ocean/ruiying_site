# What's secondary index?

Secondary index is similar to `key` but differ in

-   Only reorder specific columns instead of *entire* data.table, and record the order vector in attribute `index`
-   There can be \> 1 secondary index for a data.table (though you can have multiple keys per row).

I treat secondary index as fast and simple key for subsetting.

## Set secondary index

```{r}
setindex(flights, origin) #or setindexv()
head(flights)
names(attributes(flights))
```

## Get secondary index

```{r}
setindex(flights, origin, dest)
indices(flights)

```

# Why secondary index?

## Case 1: reordering is expensive

Using `setkey()` does two things:

-   Computing order vector

-   Reordering entire data.table

But the second one can be consuming, so secondary index do the first thing only and store the output vector into `index`.

## Case 2: there is only 1 key for 1 data.table

If we have set one key, and need to reset one, we have to re-computer and re-order entire data.table. But the secondary index allows more.

## Case 3: reuse index

The `index` attribute avoid repeated computing if an index already exists. Simply add `verbose=TRUE` in data.table arguments.

# Application of secondary index

## Fast subset using `on`

```{r}
flights["JFK", on="origin"] #works for both key and secondary index
```

## Other features as normal cases

```{r}
flights[.("LGA", "TPA"), .(arr_delay), on = c("origin", "dest")]
#find more in vignettes
```
