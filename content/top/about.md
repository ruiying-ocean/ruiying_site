# About
I am a CSC-funded PhD student at [School of Earth Sciences, University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/earthsciences/) studying planktic foraminifera, a group of marine zooplankton exsiting in the Earth since mid-Jurassic (160 Ma). Despite focusing on foram, I'm more interested in understanding the fundamental ecological questions: how global changes influence marine plankton ecology/evolution processes and corresponding functions. Now my main tool is Earth system model, cGEnIE.
