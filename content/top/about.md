# About
I am a CSC-funded PhD student at [School of Earth Sciences, University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/earthsciences/) studying planktic foraminifera, a group of zooplankton exsiting in the Earth since mid-Jurassic. Despite focusing on foram, I'm more interested in understanding the fundamental ecological questions: how global changes influence marine plankton ecology/evolution processes and corresponding functions. My main tool is GENIE, an Earth system model including ocean circulation, sea-ice and ecosytem, etc.
